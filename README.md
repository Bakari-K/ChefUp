## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv` or `virtualenv`)
- Git (to clone the repository)

---

### Running the Project Locally

1. **Clone the repository** (if not already done).

2. **Navigate into the project directory**.

3. **Create a virtual environment** using your preferred method (`python -m venv env`, for example).

4. **Activate the virtual environment**. On Windows, this is typically `env\Scripts\activate`, and on macOS/Linux it’s `source env/bin/activate`.

5. **Install dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

6. **Apply database migrations** using Django’s `migrate` command.

7. *(Optional)* **Create a superuser** to access the Django admin site.

8. **Run the development server** using Django’s `runserver` command.

9. **Visit the local URL** (usually `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`) in your web browser to view the app.
